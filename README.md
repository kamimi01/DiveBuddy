## Database Design

### Features of Firebase Realtime Database

- Firebase Realtime Database is NonSQL
  - Schemaless
    - But can have security rules like constraints in case of SQL
  - Data structure should be flat (called denormalize)


### Database Design

- Used JSON to design. Tried not to use normal ER diagrams to avoid stick to the SQL concept because I'm more familiar with SQL than NonSQL.
